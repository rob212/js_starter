# JavaScript Starter for a Code Kata 

Starter project to be used while performing a TDD code kata in JavaScript.  


## Usage

Clone this repo

Verify you have Nodejs installed...
```
node --version
```

If you don't have Nodejs installed I suggest using nvm (for mac or Linux users only):
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash
```

To confirm installation of nvm has worked, open a new terminal and run:
```
nvm --version
nvm install node
```

Once you have confirmed you now have node installed navigate to the root of this project (the directory that the package.json file exists in)

Run the npm install command to get the project dependencies:
```
npm install
```
